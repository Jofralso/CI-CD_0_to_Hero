# CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)

## What it is

CI/CD aims to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle. It involves integrating code changes frequently into a shared source code repository (continuous integration) and then delivering or deploying those changes (continuous delivery or continuous deployment).

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Definition**: Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, usually multiple times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.
- **Benefits**:
  - Early detection of integration bugs
  - Reduced integration problems
  - Immediate feedback on the status of the build

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

- **Definition**: Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI that ensures the software can be reliably released at any time. It involves automated testing beyond unit tests, such as integration and system tests.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced deployment risk
  - Faster time to market
  - Higher quality and reliability of software

### Continuous Deployment

- **Definition**: Continuous Deployment goes a step further than Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline.
- **Benefits**:
  - Immediate user feedback
  - Minimal manual intervention
  - Faster iteration cycles

## Why it's important

CI/CD helps avoid bugs, reduces complexity, increases efficiency, and allows for faster code releases. It automates manual steps, minimizing downtime and incorporating user feedback effectively.
