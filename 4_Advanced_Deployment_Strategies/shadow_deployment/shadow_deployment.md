# Advanced Deployment Strategies - Shadow Deployment

## Detailed Explanation

Shadow Deployment is a deployment strategy used to test a new version of an application by running it alongside the existing version, but without exposing it to end users. In this approach, the new version (shadow) receives a copy of the live traffic for testing purposes while the existing version (primary) continues to handle user requests. This allows for real-world testing without impacting the user experience.

### Key Concepts

- **Shadow Environment**: The new version of the application that runs in parallel with the live version but does not serve user traffic directly.
- **Live Traffic Duplication**: Real user requests are duplicated and sent to both the primary (live) version and the shadow (new) version.
- **Testing and Monitoring**: The shadow version processes the duplicated traffic to test performance, functionality, and stability, while monitoring tools capture metrics and logs for analysis.

### Advantages

- **Real-World Testing**: Allows testing of the new version with real user data and traffic patterns without affecting actual user interactions.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies potential issues and performance problems in a real-world context before fully deploying the new version.
- **No User Impact**: Users continue to interact with the existing version, ensuring a seamless experience during the testing phase.

### Disadvantages

- **Resource Intensive**: Requires additional infrastructure to run both the primary and shadow versions simultaneously, which can be resource-intensive.
- **Complexity**: Managing traffic duplication and monitoring can add complexity to the deployment process.

## Real-Life Example

### Use Case: Banking Application Update

A banking application needs to introduce a new transaction processing feature. To ensure that the new feature performs well under real-world conditions without affecting actual transactions, they use Shadow Deployment.

1. **Setup Shadow Environment**:
   - The new version of the transaction processing feature is deployed in a shadow environment that mirrors the production environment.
2. **Duplicate Traffic**:
   - Real transaction requests are duplicated and sent to both the production environment (primary) and the shadow environment.
   - The shadow environment processes these requests to test the new feature’s functionality and performance.
3. **Monitor and Analyze**:
   - Performance metrics, error rates, and transaction logs from the shadow environment are monitored to identify any issues or improvements needed.
   - The shadow version’s responses and behavior are compared with those of the primary version.
4. **Deploy or Rollback**:
   - If the shadow deployment proves successful and meets performance criteria, the new feature is rolled out to all users.
   - If issues are detected, the deployment team can make necessary adjustments or improvements before a full rollout.
