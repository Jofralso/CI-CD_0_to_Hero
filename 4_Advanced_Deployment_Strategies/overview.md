# Advanced Deployment Strategies

## Overview

Advanced deployment strategies enhance the reliability and flexibility of software releases, allowing for smoother transitions, minimal downtime, and safer rollbacks.

## Key Concepts

- **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before a full deployment.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Running two identical production environments (blue and green), switching traffic between them to minimize downtime.
- **Recreate Strategy**: Stopping the old version and starting the new version simultaneously.
- **Shadow Deployment**: Deploying a new version alongside the old one without serving live traffic, allowing testing with real user traffic.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing two versions of a service by exposing different segments of users to each version and analyzing the results.

## Practice Problems

### Easy Problem

**Task**: Implement a basic canary deployment using Docker containers.

1. Create a simple web application.
2. Define Dockerfiles for version 1 and version 2 of the application.
3. Use Docker Compose to deploy both versions and route traffic to the canary version.

### Medium Problem

**Task**: Implement a blue-green deployment using a cloud provider's services.

1. Set up two identical environments (blue and green) in the cloud.
2. Deploy version 1 to the blue environment and version 2 to the green environment.
3. Switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.

### Hard Problem

**Task**: Implement shadow deployment and A/B testing using Kubernetes.

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Deploy the old version and the new version of an application in parallel.
3. Use a traffic management tool (like Istio) to mirror traffic to the shadow deployment and perform A/B testing.

## Solutions

### Easy Problem Solution

**Steps**:

1. **Create a Simple Web Application**:

`index.html` (version 1):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Version 1</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World! Version 1</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

`index.html` (version 2):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Version 2</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World! Version 2</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Define Dockerfiles**:

`Dockerfile.v1`:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

`Dockerfile.v2`:
```

dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

3. **Use Docker Compose**:

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app-v1:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.v1
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
  app-v2:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.v2
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
```

### Medium Problem Solution

**Steps**:

1. **Set up Two Identical Environments**:

   Use your cloud provider's tools to create two environments (blue and green). For example, in AWS, you might use two separate EC2 instances.

2. **Deploy Version 1 to Blue Environment**:

   Deploy version 1 of your application to the blue environment.

3. **Deploy Version 2 to Green Environment**:

   Deploy version 2 of your application to the green environment.

4. **Switch Traffic**:

   Update your DNS or load balancer configuration to direct traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.

### Hard Problem Solution

**Steps**:

1. **Set up a Kubernetes Cluster**:

   Use a managed Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

2. **Deploy the Old and New Versions**:

   `deployment-v1.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-v1
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
         version: v1
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
           version: v1
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:v1
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

   `deployment-v2.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-v2
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
         version: v2
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
           version: v2
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:v2
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

3. **Use a Traffic Management Tool**:

   Install Istio and configure traffic mirroring and A/B testing rules.

   `virtualservice.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     hosts:
     - "*"
     http:
     - route:
       - destination:
           host: myapp-v1
         weight: 50
       - destination:
           host: myapp-v2
         weight: 50
     - mirror:
         host: myapp-v2
   ```

4. **Analyze Results**:

   Use Istio's telemetry and monitoring features to collect and analyze data from the A/B tests.
